# DPViz - A Visualizer Program for Comparing Recursion and Dynamic Programming
This project was completed for the final portion of CS338301 Algorithms, taught by [Lewis Tseng](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/computer-science/people/faculty-directory/lewis-tseng.html). It is primarily a Python/Tk program, `DP_Visualizer.py`, which can visualize the computation of various problems in both their recursive and dynamic programming formulations. This repository also houses the `dpviz.py` module, which can be used more generally to inspect the run of DP methods in Python.
